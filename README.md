# hugo-mock-landing-page

This github page advertises the LUKA which is an infant mattress with embedded sensors that can detect heart rate and respiration rate for continuous health monitoring. The device also uses this data to recognize if the infant is in medical distress and alerts the parents in livetime of any issues.

Workflow Description-
The workflow created is 'Build and Deploy Github Pages' and allows the me as the github repo manager to view changes as they are occuring live and where the repo currently is in the workflow process, specifically in the building and deployment of the github pages. This inside view into the github's workflow can allow me to debug issues more easily and better understand the inner workings of the process because I can specifically which steps the repo is taking the deploy the pages instead of simply seeing the result.
